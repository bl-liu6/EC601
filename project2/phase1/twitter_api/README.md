# Twitter API 
Sample code for the Twitter API v2 endpoints.
Individual API features have folders where you can find examples of usage in several coding languages (Java, Node.js, Python, R, and Ruby).

* [Twitter API Documentation](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/about-twitter-api)

## Prerequisites

* Twitter API Essential Access ([sign up here](https://t.co/signup))
* A Project and an App created [in the dashboard](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard)


## Language-specific requirements


### JavaScript (Node.js) environment set up

You will need to have Node.js installed to run this code. All Node.js examples use `needle` as the HTTP client, which needs to be npm installed. For OAuth with user context requests, you'll need to install the `got` and `oauth-1.0a` packages.

```bash
npm install needle
npm install got
npm install oauth-1.0a
```


## Additional resources

We maintain a [Postman](https://getpostman.com) Collection which you can use for exercising individual API endpoints.
