# Twitter API [![v2](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwbadges.glitch.me%2Fbadges%2Fv2)](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api)

Sample code for the Twitter API v2 endpoints.
Individual API features have folders where you can find examples of usage in several coding languages (Java, Node.js, Python, R, and Ruby).

* [Twitter API Documentation](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/about-twitter-api)

## Prerequisites

* Twitter API Essential Access ([sign up here](https://t.co/signup))
* A Project and an App created [in the dashboard](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard)


## Language-specific requirements


### JavaScript (Node.js) environment set up

You will need to have Node.js installed to run this code. All Node.js examples use `needle` as the HTTP client, which needs to be npm installed. For OAuth with user context requests, you'll need to install the `got` and `oauth-1.0a` packages.

```bash
npm install needle
npm install got
npm install oauth-1.0a
```


## Additional resources

We maintain a [Postman](https://getpostman.com) Collection which you can use for exercising individual API endpoints.
